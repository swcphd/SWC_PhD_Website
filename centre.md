### The Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit

The Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit was created at University College London (UCL) in July 1998, funded by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation . The Unit consists of five faculty members, about ten post-doctoral researchers, about fifteen research students and five support staff.
The research objectives of the Gatsby Unit are to study neural computational theories of perception and action in neural and machine systems, with an emphasis on learning. The research activity of the Unit is overseen by a Scientific Advisory Board. The Unit's teaching activities are centered on an innovative four-year PhD programme in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning.

Our visitor programme enables members of the Unit to work with leading researchers from across the world on a range of short and long term research collaborations. We also host a seminar programme with talks by Unit members, other UCL staff and guest speakers.

By establishing the centre, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation has provided a unique opportunity for a critical mass of theoreticians to interact closely with each other and with University College's other world class research groups in neuroscience and related areas.

The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre brings together world-leading neuroscientists driven by a common scientific goal: to understand how neural circuits in the brain give rise to the fundamental processes underpinning behaviour. 

We wish to inspire a culture of bold research, innovation and collaboration between scientists embedded in 14 interdisciplinary experimental research groups accommodated in our new, purpose-designed, seven-storey building located near the main UCL campus in central London. Experimental groups will work closely with theorists at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit located in the same building.
