## Integrating findings across different nervous systems

### 21st September 2018 - Sainsbury Wellcome Centre

The goal of this event is to think about and discuss how neuroscientific 
research methods can be improved in order
 to better integrate research findings from individual species into general principles of nervous systems.
  Neuroscientists today study many species, but results obtained with one species rarely inform the
   design or analysis of experiments with another. This raises the question of how studying multiple
    species can help us ultimately understand the relationship between nervous system function and
     behaviour.
     
     
Speakers: Suzana Herculano-Houzel, Gilles Laurent, Marta Moita
Panel: Jennifer Bizley, Tim Behrens, Andre Brown
