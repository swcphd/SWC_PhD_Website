Currently there is no agreement between neuroscientists as to what can be described as a computational
 unit of the brain. Historically, single neurons have claimed the title as the functional
  unit of the nervous system, whilst more modern imaging methods have pointed towards neuronal
   ensembles as being a more robust feature to focus on. Furthermore, the participation of glia
    in information encoding has been largely ignored, whilst others argue that a more thorough
     decomposition of behaviour is necessary before we can even begin to understand the brain’s
      computation.

More often than not, the cross-talk between researchers working on these different levels
 of abstraction is quite spare, and we believe bringing researchers together to discuss these
  questions will help promote collaboration and further our understanding of the important questions
   in neuroscience, that can’t be solved just by looking from one point of view.
