# Decision making 
## choosing the tools to discover the rules

We want to ask the question of how we can best study the neural circuits underlying decisions?
 To address this question, we need to discuss different types of decision making across different
  species, as well as different methods that are being used in the field. Therefore,
   we are inviting speakers working with drosophila, rodents, monkeys and humans, as well
    as a speaker who focuses on theoretical and computational aspects of decision making.
    
    
Speakers: Scott Waddell, Anne Churchland, Tiago Branco, Jill O’Reilly, Alexandre Pouget
