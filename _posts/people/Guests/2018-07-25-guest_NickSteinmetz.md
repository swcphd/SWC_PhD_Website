Nick is a Senior Research Associate in the lab of Profs. Matteo Carandini and Kenneth Harris
 at University College London. My research at UCL focuses on understanding the neural 
 circuits and systems that underlie perception and cognition across the brain. I approach 
 these questions through a combination of large-scale electrophysiology with Neuropixels
  probes, calcium imaging across neocortical areas, and systematic optogenetic manipulations,
   all in combination with a sophisticated behavioral task for mice.
