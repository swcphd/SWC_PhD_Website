## Biography
My interest in Neuroscience stems from my school years, when I came across neurodegenerative
 diseases during a project in nursing homes. Following this interest in the biology behind the disease,
  I obtained a degree in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Barcelona in 2015.
   During my undergraduate years I had the opportunity to discover Neuroscience
    research by taking part in projects at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich
     and the University of Barcelona. I was fascinated by the challenge of unravelling
      the biology of the brain, and so in 2015 I moved to London to start my MRes+PhD 
      in Developmental Neurobiology at King´s College London. In my PhD project I aim to investigate
       whether neurons encode information in units – action potentials – as a simple digital code,
        or whether the voltage signal can be fine-tuned in an analogue manner in the axon.
         When I am not meddling with my microscope or with my code, I enjoy dancing, reading 
         and practising sports such as running or climbing.
