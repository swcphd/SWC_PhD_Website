The Isogai lab at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre investigates social behaviors as
 a fascinating model to delineate the links between genes, circuits 
 and complex natural behaviors. We use molecular and systems neuroscience
  approaches to discover the molecular underpinnings of neural circuit functions and
   to resolve two major questions in neuroscience:



1) How are social cues, including pheromones, detected and processed in the brain?

2) How do genes control neural circuit homeostasis, modulation, and reprogramming?



We focus on developing cutting-edge methods that enable us to tackle these questions
 from unique perspectives. We thereby aim to attain a detailed understanding of the molecular
  and neural basis for how external stimuli impact the physiology and behavior of animals.
