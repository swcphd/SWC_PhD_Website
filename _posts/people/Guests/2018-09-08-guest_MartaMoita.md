Living in a group has an adaptive value for a number of reasons.
 In the lab we focus on social interactions in different contexts, 
 namely when individuals perceive a threat or when they are foraging for food. 
 The neural mechanisms by which animals use social information to detect impending 
 danger are largely unknown. We are studying how animals use defence behaviours of 
 con-specifics as alarm cues. In addition, we study how the social context modulates 
 defence behaviours. For example, we are studying how the presence of offspring affects 
 defence behaviours displayed by mothers. We are also studying prosocial behaviour of 
 rats using food foraging tasks. Here we would like to understand what drives an animal 
 to coordinate with another or to perform an action that benefits another in the absence 
 of self-benefit. To understand the mechanisms by which social interactions shape behaviour 
 we use a combination of behavioural, pharmacological and optogenetic tools in rats and fruit flies.
