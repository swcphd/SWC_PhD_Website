We do cross-species investigations that try to investigate neural codes
 and mechanisms that underlie higher cognition. We are currently trying
  to understand how the brain stores information about relationships between
   things in the world. We find it useful to use mathematical and computational
    models to try to understand what coding principles are possible or likely,
     and we try to invent novel imaging approaches to measure them in humans. 
     It is difficult to infer microscopic coding principles from coarse macroscopic data,
      so we often find ourselves retreating to nonhuman models to validate our conclusions.
       But it is important to be able to investigate neural coding principles in humans
        where behvaviour is complex and subjects can perform naturally. It is also exciting 
        to devise such approaches as it potentially allows clinical investigations in 
        humans to specify questions at the level of mechanisms. Currently, a PhD in humans
         with me would likely involve performing brain imaging and computational
          experiments to understand how neuronal codes can simultaneously represent many
           relationships between objects and agents in our environment; and represent
            these in ways that allow efficient planning and acting in this environment. 
            Students could also be co-supervised between myself and Steve Kennerley to 
            investigate similar issues with electrophysiological recordings.
