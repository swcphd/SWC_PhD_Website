## Biography
Elisa trained in Italy at the University of Pavia (BSc Biology, MSc Neurobiology) with Egidio
 D’Angelo as a cellular electrophysiologist, where her first interest has been investigating
  the cerebellar computation at a cellular and synaptic level. For her graduate studies she
   then moved to Chris De Zeeuw’s laboratory in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where she received
    a complete training in cellular, system and behavioural neuroscience. Thanks to a Sir
     Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship, she then spent four years investigating experience-driven
      plasticity in bulbar dopaminergic interneurons and the effects of such plastic modifications
       on the first synapse in olfaction and on olfactory behaviour in Matthew Grubb's lab
        (King’s College London) and Venki Murthy's lab (Harvard University). In May 2018 she started
         her lab at the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience at the University
          of Cambridge.
