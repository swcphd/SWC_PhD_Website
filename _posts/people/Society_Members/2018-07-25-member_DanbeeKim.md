> Danbee Kim is currently a PhD candidate in the 2013 cohort of the International Neuroscience 
Doctoral Programme, headquartered at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisboa, Portugal.
 They joined the Intelligent Systems Lab in Sept 2013 and moved with the lab to the Sainsbury Wellcome
  Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour in London, UK in 2015. 

> Danbee's research combines studies of cuttlefish, the philosophy of science,
 Perceptual Control Theory, and the evolution of “the brain” throughout time and in many species.
  In collaboration with NeuroGears, they build interactive art installations that both allow people
   to participate in field neuroscience experiments, and communicate science in fun and interesting ways.
    You can learn more at www.EveryMind.Online, and at Danbee's personal website, www.danbeekim.org.

> Danbee spends a lot of time thinking about permaculture, anarchy, circus,
 and education. They love teaching and being in the wilderness, especially 
 in the mountains and by the sea. They also train and play as a musician, capoeirista,
  and VIRS (vigilante intergalactic roustabout scholar).
