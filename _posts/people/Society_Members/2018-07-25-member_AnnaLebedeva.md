> Anna's role in a PhD society is to organise and coordinate the symposia.
 This includes choosing a topic and the format of the event, inviting speakers
  that work on the topic and complement each other, taking care of the venue
   and the guest list.

> Anna Lebedeva studies innate behaviours, including escaping from threatening stimuli, in two species: zebrafish and mice.
 The aim of the research is to discover the mechanism that implements the visuo-motor transformation,
  while using the best of both worlds: light-sheet imaging, allowing to record the majority of the fish's brain
   simultaneously with behaviour, and complicated decision making process underlying mouse escape in complex situations,
    while recording a limited set of neurons.

> Anna's previous work includes research projects at the VU University of Amsterdam,
 where she did electrophysiology recordings in mouse and human brain tissue; at the UCSF,
  where she studied primary visual cortex plasticity in adult mice using calcium imaging.
   Her rotations as a PhD student at SWC include a project in the lab of prof. Carandini and prof.
    Harris, a project in Dr. Bianco lab and a project in Dr. Branco lab. Her undergraduate research
     was conducted at the department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Moscow State University, where
      she focused on statistics and graph theory
